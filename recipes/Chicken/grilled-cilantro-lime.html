        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Chicken thighs</li>
                <li>Limes</li>
                <li>Fresh Cilantro</li>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
                <li>Honey</li>
                <li>Cumin</li>
                <li>Kosher Salt and Pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk together the Mexican chicken marinade and pour ¾ of it over the chicken thighs, reserving some for serving.</li>
                <li>Seal the chicken in a zip-top freezer bag and set in the fridge to marinate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Prepare clean grill grates to minimize sticking and preheat the grill at 400-450°F.</li>
                <li>Arrange the chicken on the hot grill grates and cook for 4-6 minutes with the lid closed. If the chicken sticks to the grill grate, let it cook a minute more before trying to flip. Cook on the second side for another 4-5 minutes. Baste with some of the reserved marinade, flip, and cook for 1-2 minutes more. Repeat on the other side side. The chicken is done when the internal temp is 160°F and the juices run clear. Let the chicken rest a few minutes for the temp to raise to 165°F and the juices to settle before serving.</li>
                <li>Drizzle with additional reserved marinade just before serving, and garnish with cilantro and lime wedges.</li>
                <li>Preheat the grill at 400-450°F and clean the grill grates to minimize sticking.</li>
                <li>I cooked this cilantro lime chicken for about 15 minutes total, but your grill will cook different than mine, and the thickness of the chicken breasts will vary, so judge when it’s done by the internal temperature.

                    Test to see doneness when the juices run clear and internal temp is at about 160 degrees F. I always let the chicken sit for a minute or two before slicing to hold in the juices.</li>
            </ol>
